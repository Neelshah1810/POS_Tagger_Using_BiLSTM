# Deep BiLSTM POS Tagger for Morphologically Rich Languages

This project presents an advanced Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging system for English and Hindi, using a Deep Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture. It is specifically designed to handle morphologically rich languages (MRLs) which often have complex word formations and high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates.

The project includes the complete training pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook (`POS_Tagger.ipynb`) and an interactive web application (`streamlit_pos_tagger.py`) to demonstrate the model's capabilities.

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy Models**: Achieves over 96% accuracy on test datasets for both English and Hindi.
- **Advanced Architecture**: Implements an enhanced BiLSTM model with:
    - Character-level CNN embeddings to capture morphological features and handle unknown words.
    - An attention mechanism to improve contextual understanding.
    - Layer normalization and advanced regularization (AdamW, weight decay, learning rate scheduling) for stable training.
- **Multi-lingual Support**: Provides pre-trained models for Hindi and English.
- **Interactive UI**: A Streamlit application allows for easy, real-time POS tagging of custom sentences.
- **Reproducible Training**: The `POS_Tagger.ipynb` notebook contains the full code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on the Universal Dependencies datasets.

## Model Architecture & Performance

The core of the system is a deep, multi-layer BiLSTM that learns contextual dependencies from both left-to-right and right-to-left. To better capture the morphological richness of languages like Hindi, the model incorporates character-level embeddings generated by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The final models achieve the following accuracies on their respective test sets:

- **Hindi**: ~96.8%
- **English**: ~96.7%

The models were trained on the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) project datasets: `UD_English-GUM` and `UD_Hindi-HDTB`.

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository or download the project files.**

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: The project uses PyTorch. If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, you may want to install a version of PyTorch that supports it for better performance. See the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for instructions.*

## Usage

To run the interactive POS tagging application, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_pos_tagger.py
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the application interface.

From there, you can:
1.  Select either **Hindi** or **English** from the sidebar.
2.  Enter a sentence in the text box.
3.  Click the **"Analyze"** button to see the POS tags for each word.
4.  View detailed statistics and download the results.
